	<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
	<h4>Q: Why should I invest in a photovoltaic system with storage?</h4>
	<p>Since 2017, the Energy Strategy 2050 aims to promote the use of renewable energies in Switzerland. Our STROMSACK photovoltaic (PV) system with storage helps you to efficiently produce your own energy at home and store the surplus energy for future use anytime, anywhere (e.g. to charge your devices including EVs outdoors). With a PV system and storage, you pay for less electricity from the grid. Therefore, you also become less dependent on the price of electricity.</p>

	<h4>Q: What makes STROMSACK better than other energy providers? Why be a prosumer?</h4>
	<p>ATROMSACK’s PV system is the first in the country that allows you to use your stored energy outdoors anytime. This is facilitated in two ways: public charging stations for your devices, as well as “smart” meters that can be installed at a remote address (i.e. far away from your house). The energy stored and used outdoors is accounted for in terms of virtual electricityCoins (ELCs), which can also be shared with your friends and family members who are prosumers.</p>

	<h4>Q: How does the STROMSACK “energy storage” work?</h4>
	<p>The surplus energy that you wish to store is fed into a public energy grid. In return, you are given a certain amount of virtual electricityCoins (ELCs) corresponding to the amount of energy stored. These ELCs are added to your personal balance, and can be used at any STROMSACK charging station outdoors, or even indoors with the required hardware (smart meters). They can also be shared with your friends and family members who are prosumers.</p>

	<h4>Q: Which requirements should my house fulfil for a PV system to produce energy?</h4>
	<p>The roof should cover an area of at least 20m<sup>2</sup> and be able to support a small amount of additional weight (for the installation of the PV system). The roof should also face south as much as possible. Optimal energy production occurs in bright, clear conditions.</p>

	<h4>Q: Do I need to log out of the public charging station after I have finished using it?</h4>
	<p>For cost and security reasons, the charging station logs you out after 30 seconds of inactivity.</p>

	<h4>Q: Can I also use my stored ELCs indoors?</h4>
	<p>Yes, you would need a “smart” meter to allow and keep track of your usage of ELCs indoors. The meter, together with its user manual, will be delivered to your house for installation. If you wish to use your ELCs at a separate address request an additional appointment for hardware installation at the second address. (See <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> page.)</p>

	<h4>Q: Tell me more about the technology behind the virtual electricityCoins(ELCs).</h4>
	<p>STROMSACK makes use of blockchain technology, which allows transactions such as the sharing of ELCs between prosumers. Sharing is mediated by “smart contracts”, which are computer codes that help to verify or enforce the performance of these transactions, stored as a public ledger. In total, there are 10000 ELCs in circulation. The virtual service fee for the use of your stored energy is 15 millionths of an ELC per kWh.</p>

	<h4>Q: How many users are there?</h4>
	<p>Due to ever-increasing customer numbers, an up to date figure can not be given. As of December 31st, 2017, there were over ten thousand customers participating in STROMSACK.</p>
